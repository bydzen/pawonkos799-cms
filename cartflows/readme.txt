**#1 WooCommerce Checkout & Funnel Builder For WooCommerce**
★★★★★<br>

More WooCommerce store owners choose CartFlows than all other checkout options combined. Why? Because CartFlows helps WooCommerce stores sell more! Being free probably helps too!

We created CartFlows to make it simple for busy store owners to increase WooCommerce checkout conversions with just a few minutes of effort. You also can create unlimited sales funnels to increase your stores AOV (Average Order Value).

## Why Upgrade Your WooCommerce Checkout? ##

The easier it is to do something, the more likely people are to do it. That’s the philosophy behind CartFlows. To make it easy for you to streamline store checkout which, in turn, makes it easy for customers to make a purchase.

Lets face it, the default WooCommerce checkout doesn’t cut it anymore (if it ever did). You can end up losing sales because there are too many distractions, too much manual effort for the buyer and it just doesn’t flow well.

Over the years, we’ve noted repeating trends of what works and what doesn’t for WooCommerce checkouts and the broader eCommerce industry.

Everything we learned has been combined into a single, easy-to-use WooCommerce checkout replacement that can improve store conversions with just a few minutes of effort. We call it Modern Checkout.

## Modern Checkout For Conversions ##

Introducing a new checkout experience that outperforms the default WooCommerce checkout in every way.

* Fresh new modern look and feel
* Fast, frictionless checkout for your customers
* Optimized to get you more conversions

Lets go over each of these WooCommerce checkout improvements one by one:

* **Express checkout** – Skip the forms. Let users pay using their preferred payment gateways that directly integrate with CartFlows.
* **Single or two column layouts** – Gain greater control with our layout options. Have two columns like most stores or a single column if you want to add more content such as testimonials, guarantees and FAQs.
* **Real-time email validation** – Check if the account exists as your customer begins typing their email address. If it does, the password field is automatically displayed. If not, customers can check a box and their checkout details can be used to create their user account!
* **Google address autocomplete** – The address field displays address suggestions as your customers begin typing. Once they select an address, the rest of the fields are auto-filled.
* **New field interactions** – Have a more compact field layout by placing the labels in the field with an elegant animation as the buyer starts inputting their data.
* **Field manager** – Add, remove, and reorder fields on your checkout page easily with the Modern Checkout layout.
* **Coupon box control** – We have moved the coupon box to a better location and provided the option to display it collapsed or hide it altogether.
* **Order button control** – You can customize the text of the order button and optionally show a padlock and the order total inside the button.
* **Order summary box** – As a customer fills out the order, the order summary will follow them. And even better, on mobile it will display collapsed.
* **Modern skeleton loader** – With WooCommerce customers see a spinning wheel when they change anything related to the order. It has a really dated look. We fixed it with a modern skeleton loader that is absolutely gorgeous.

We want your WooCommerce store to be more profitable than ever, so we are giving you all the above for free.

But that’s not all, you can also create high converting sales funnels with our WooCommerce sales funnel builder.

## Why Are Sales Funnels Important? ##

You might not realize it, but if you have purchased anything online, you have gone through a sales funnel. They are used in almost every online store you have likely ever visited.

Visit Apple’s website. Did you see a shop page and product pages that all look the same, then a checkout? No you didn’t because Apple uses dedicated sales funnels for each of their products.

Funnels guide customers step-by-step through the buying or lead generation process. What you want the customer to do at the end may be different, but how you get them there is exactly the same.

You may want them to download an eBook, purchase a product, schedule a call, or buy a service, whatever is most relevant to your business.

A properly optimized funnel helps users make the journey from being a prospect to a lead or customer, without any distractions. All so you can generate higher ROI and increased profits.

Major reasons to have an optimized funnel on your website or online store include:

* **Increased average order value:** Increase the average order value (AOV) in your online store with upsells or order bumps.
* **Optimized for conversions:** Get more conversions with CartFlows’ optimized checkout pages designed for a better user experience and higher conversions.
* **Better return on investment:** Gain higher returns from your marketing or advertising spend with higher AOVs and conversions.
